This code defines a function named _islower that checks if a given character is lowercase or not. The function takes a single parameter, an integer representing the ASCII value of the character to check.
int _islower(int c)
The function definition starts with a comment that explains what the function does. It says that the function checks for lowercase characters and returns 1 if the character is lowercase, and 0 otherwise.
/** 
* _islower - checks for lowercase character 
* @c: the character to check 
* Return: 1 if c is lowercase, 0 otherwise 
*/
Inside the function, the return statement uses a logical expression to check if the given character c is lowercase or not. This is done by checking if the ASCII value of the character is between the ASCII values of lowercase letters 'a' and 'z'.
return (c >= 'a' && c <= 'z');
If the character c is between 'a' and 'z' inclusive, the expression will evaluate to true (1), and the function will return 1. Otherwise, the expression will evaluate to false (0), and the function will return 0.
In summary, this code defines a function _islower that checks if a given character is lowercase or not. It achieves this by checking if the ASCII value of the character is between the ASCII values of lowercase letters 'a' and 'z'. The function returns 1 if the character is lowercase, and 0 otherwise.
