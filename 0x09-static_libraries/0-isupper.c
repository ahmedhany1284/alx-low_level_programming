This is a C program that contains a function called _isupper which determines if a given character is an uppercase letter. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:
#include "main.h"
This line includes the header file "main.h" which contains the function prototype for _isupper.
/** * _isupper - uppercase letters 
* @c: char to check 
* 
* Return: 0 or 1 
*/
This is a documentation comment that explains what the _isupper function does, what parameter it takes, and what it returns.
int _isupper(int c) 
{
This is the beginning of the _isupper function definition. The function takes a single parameter c which is of type int (but represents a character).
if (c >= 'A' && c <= 'Z') 
return (1); 
else 
return (0); 
}
This is the body of the _isupper function. It first checks if the input character is between the ASCII values of 'A' and 'Z', inclusive. If it is, the function returns 1 to indicate that the character is an uppercase letter. If it is not, the function returns 0 to indicate that the character is not an uppercase letter.
To summarize, this program defines a function called _isupper that takes a single parameter, checks if it represents an uppercase letter, and returns 1 if it does and 0 if it does not.
