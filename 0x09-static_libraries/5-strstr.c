This code defines a function named _strstr that takes two string pointers as arguments - haystack and needle. The function searches for the first occurrence of the needle string in the haystack string and returns a pointer to the first character of the match. If the needle string is not found, the function returns a null pointer.
Let's go through the code line by line:
#include "main.h"
This line includes the main.h header file in our program. The contents of this file are not shown in the code snippet provided, but it likely contains function declarations or macros that are used in this code or elsewhere in the program.
/** 
* _strstr - Entry point 
* @haystack: input 
* @needle: input 
* Return: Always 0 (Success) 
*/
This is a documentation comment that explains the purpose and behavior of the _strstr function. The @haystack and @needle notations indicate that these parameters are being documented. The comment also specifies that the function always returns 0, which is incorrect and should be updated.
char *_strstr(char *haystack, char *needle)
This line defines the _strstr function that takes two string pointers as arguments - haystack and needle. The function returns a pointer to the first character of the match in the haystack string or a null pointer if the needle string is not found.
for (; *haystack != '\0'; haystack++) 
{ 
char *l = haystack; 
char *p = needle; 

while (*l == *p && *p != '\0') 
{ 
l++; 
p++; 
} 
if (*p == '\0') 
return (haystack); 
}
This is the main logic of the _strstr function. It uses a loop to iterate through each character in the haystack string until it reaches the null terminator. The loop increments the haystack pointer for each iteration, effectively moving it to the next character in the haystack string.
For each character in the haystack string, the function uses two pointer variables l and p to compare the characters in the haystack and needle strings. The l pointer points to the current character in the haystack string, while the p pointer points to the first character in the needle string.
The inner loop compares each character in the haystack and needle strings until either a mismatch is found or the needle string is fully matched. If a mismatch is found, the inner loop exits and the outer loop continues to the next character in the haystack string.
If the needle string is fully matched, the function returns a pointer to the first character of the match in the haystack string.
return (0);
This line returns a null pointer if the function reaches the end of the haystack string without finding a match.
Overall, this code is a simple implementation of a function that searches for the first occurrence of a substring in a larger string. The function takes two string pointers as arguments and returns a pointer to the first character of the match in the haystack string or a null pointer if the needle string is not found.
