This is a C program that contains a function called _isdigit which checks if a given integer value represents a digit. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:
#include "main.h"
This line includes the header file "main.h" which contains the function prototype for _isdigit.
/** 
* _isdigit - checks for a digit (0 through 9) 
* @c: int to be checked 
* Return: 1 if c is a digit, 0 otherwise 
*/
This is a documentation comment that explains what the _isdigit function does, what parameter it takes, and what it returns.
int _isdigit(int c) 
{ 
return (c >= '0' && c <= '9'); 
}
This is the function definition of _isdigit. It takes a single parameter c, which is the integer value to be checked. The function returns 1 if the value is a digit (i.e. it falls between the ASCII values of '0' and '9'), and 0 otherwise.
The function implementation uses a Boolean expression that checks if the value of c falls between the ASCII values of '0' and '9'. If it does, the expression evaluates to 1, which is returned by the function. If it does not, the expression evaluates to 0, which is also returned by the function.
In summary, this program defines a function called _isdigit that takes an integer value as input and checks if it represents a digit. If it does, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it returns 0.
