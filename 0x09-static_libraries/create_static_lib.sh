This is a shell script named create_static_lib.sh that is used to create a static library from a collection of C source files in the current directory.
#!/bin/bash
This line specifies that the script should be run using the Bash shell.
gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -c *.c
This line uses the gcc command to compile all C source files in the current directory (*.c) into object files (-c flag) with a set of warning options (-Wall, -pedantic, -Werror, -Wextra). The -Wall flag enables all warning messages, -pedantic flag makes gcc conform strictly to the C standard, -Werror flag turns all warnings into errors, and -Wextra flag enables some additional warnings.
ar -rc liball.a *.o
This line uses the ar command to create a static library file named liball.a (-rc flags). The *.o pattern matches all object files in the current directory and adds them to the library. The -r flag specifies that the object files should be added to the library if they are newer than any existing files in the library, and the -c flag specifies that the library should be created if it does not already exist.
ranlib liball.a
This line uses the ranlib command to add an index to the static library file liball.a. The index is used by the linker to quickly locate the object files in the library when linking them into a program.
In summary, this shell script compiles all C source files in the current directory into object files, creates a static library file named liball.a from the object files using the ar command, and adds an index to the library file using the ranlib command.
