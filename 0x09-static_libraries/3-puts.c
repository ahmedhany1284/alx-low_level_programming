This code defines a function named _puts that prints a given string to the standard output, followed by a newline character. The function takes a single parameter, a pointer to the string to print.
void _puts(char *str)
The function definition starts with a comment that explains what the function does. It says that the function prints a string, followed by a newline character, to the standard output.
/** 
* _puts - prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout 
* @str: string to print 
*/
Inside the function, a while loop is used to print each character of the string to the standard output. The loop continues until the null character ('\0') is encountered, indicating the end of the string.
while (*str != '\0') 
{ 
_putchar(*str++); 
}
Inside the loop, the _putchar function is used to print the current character of the string to the standard output. The str pointer is incremented by 1 to move to the next character in the string.
After the loop, a newline character ('\n') is printed to the standard output using the _putchar function.
_putchar('\n');
In summary, this code defines a function _puts that prints a given string to the standard output, followed by a newline character. It achieves this by using a while loop to print each character of the string using the _putchar function, followed by a newline character.
