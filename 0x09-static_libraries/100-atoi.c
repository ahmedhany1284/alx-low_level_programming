This code defines a function named _atoi that takes a pointer to a character string as input and returns an integer.
int _atoi(char *s)
The function definition starts with some comments that describe the function. The purpose of the _atoi function is to convert a string into an integer.
/** 
* _atoi - convert a string into an integer. 
* 
* @s: the string to use. 
* 
* Return: integer. 
*/
The function initializes three variables sign, i and res.
int sign = 1, i = 0; 
unsigned int res = 0;
The variable sign is used to keep track of the sign of the integer, which is initially set to positive. The variable i is used to keep track of the index of the string being processed. The variable res is used to store the result of the conversion.
The function starts with a while loop that skips over any non-digit characters in the string until it finds the first digit character. This loop also handles the sign of the number, if it exists.
while (!(s[i] <= '9' && s[i] >= '0') && s[i] != '\0') 
{
if (s[i] == '-') 
sign *= -1; 
i++; 
}
The loop condition checks whether the current character is not a digit (s[i] <= '9' && s[i] >= '0') and is not the null character (s[i] != '\0'). If this condition is true, the loop body is executed.
The loop body first checks whether the current character is a minus sign (s[i] == '-'). If it is, the sign variable is multiplied by -1, which flips its sign to negative. The loop then increments the i variable to move to the next character in the string.
After this loop, the function moves on to another while loop that converts the string to an integer. This loop iterates over the digit characters in the string and adds them to the result, multiplying the result by 10 each time to shift it left by one digit.
while (s[i] <= '9' && (s[i] >= '0' && s[i] != '\0')) 
{ 
res = (res * 10) + (s[i] - '0'); 
i++; 
}
The loop condition checks whether the current character is a digit (s[i] <= '9' && s[i] >= '0') and is not the null character (s[i] != '\0'). If this condition is true, the loop body is executed.
The loop body first subtracts the character '0' from the current character s[i] to convert it from a character to a digit. It then multiplies the result by 10 and adds the digit to the result to shift the result left by one digit and add the current digit to the result. The loop then increments the i variable to move to the next character in the string.
After this loop, the function multiplies the result by the sign to make it negative if the sign was negative.
res *= sign;
Finally, the function returns the result as an integer.
return (res);
