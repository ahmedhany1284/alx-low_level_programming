This is a header file, which contains function prototypes for various string manipulation functions.
The #ifndef preprocessor directive is used to check if MAIN_H has already been defined. If it hasn't been defined, the contents of the header file are included. If it has been defined, the contents are ignored. This is done to prevent the contents of the header file from being included multiple times in the same program.
The functions included in this header file are:
_putchar: Writes a single character to standard output.
_islower: Checks if a character is a lowercase letter.
_isalpha: Checks if a character is an alphabetic letter (either uppercase or lowercase).
_abs: Computes the absolute value of an integer.
_isupper: Checks if a character is an uppercase letter.
_isdigit: Checks if a character is a digit.
_strlen: Computes the length of a string.
_puts: Writes a string to standard output.
_strcpy: Copies a string from source to destination.
_atoi: Converts a string to an integer.
_strcat: Concatenates two strings.
_strncat: Concatenates a specified number of characters from one string to another.
_strncpy: Copies a specified number of characters from one string to another.
_strcmp: Compares two strings lexicographically.
_memset: Sets a specified number of bytes in a string to a specified value.
_memcpy: Copies a specified number of bytes from source to destination.
_strchr: Searches a string for a specified character and returns a pointer to the first occurrence of that character.
_strspn: Computes the length of the maximum initial segment of a string that consists entirely of characters from a specified set.
_strpbrk: Searches a string for any of a specified set of characters and returns a pointer to the first occurrence of any of those characters.
_strstr: Searches a string for a specified substring and returns a pointer to the first occurrence of that substring.
All of these functions are declared as extern, which means that they are defined in another source file and can be used in this program. The purpose of this header file is to provide a way for other source files in the program to access these functions without having to know their implementations.
