This code defines a function named _strlen that takes a pointer to a character array (string) as its parameter and returns an integer representing the length of the string.
int _strlen(char *s)
The function definition starts with a comment that explains what the function does. It says that the function returns the length of a string, which is a common operation in C programming.
/** 
* _strlen - returns the length of a string 
* @s: string 
* Return: length 
*/
Inside the function, a variable longi of type int is declared and initialized to 0.
int longi = 0;
Then, a while loop is used to iterate over the characters of the string. The loop continues until the end of the string is reached, which is indicated by the null character ('\0').
while (*s != '\0') 
{ 
longi++; 
s++; 
}
Inside the loop, the longi variable is incremented by 1 for each character in the string. The s pointer is also incremented by 1 to move to the next character in the string.
After the loop, the function returns the value of the longi variable, which represents the length of the string.
return (longi);
In summary, this code defines a function _strlen that takes a string as its input and returns its length. It achieves this by using a while loop to count the number of characters in the string and then returning the count.
