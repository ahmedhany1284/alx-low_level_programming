This code defines the function _strchr which searches for the first occurrence of a character c in the string s. The function takes two parameters: a pointer to a string s and a character c to search for in the string. It returns a pointer to the first occurrence of the character c in the string s, or NULL if the character is not found.
Here is a step-by-step explanation of the code:
#include "main.h" includes the header file main.h, which contains the prototypes for all the functions used in the program.
#include <stddef.h> includes the header file stddef.h, which defines the NULL pointer.
The function _strchr is defined with the following signature: char *_strchr(char *s, char c). It takes a pointer to a string s and a character c as input parameters and returns a pointer to the first occurrence of c in s, or NULL if c is not found.
Inside the function, an integer variable i is declared and initialized to zero.
The function uses a for loop to iterate over each character in the string s. The loop continues as long as s[i] is not equal to the null terminator (\0).
Inside the loop, an if statement is used to check if the current character s[i] is equal to the character we are searching for c. If they are equal, the address of the current character &s[i] is returned.
If the character c is not found in the string, the loop continues until the end of the string is reached and the function returns NULL.
Finally, the function ends and control is returned to the caller.
