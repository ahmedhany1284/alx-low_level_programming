This code defines a function named _abs that takes an integer n as input and computes its absolute value. The function returns the absolute value of the input integer.
Let's go through the code line by line:
#include "main.h"
This line includes the main.h header file in our program. The contents of this file are not shown in the code snippet provided, but it likely contains function declarations or macros that are used in this code or elsewhere in the program.
/** 
* _abs - computes the absolute value of an integer 
* @n: the int to check 
* Return: the absolute value of int 
*/
This is a documentation comment that explains the purpose and behavior of the _abs function. The @n notation indicates that the n parameter is being documented. The comment also specifies that the function returns the absolute value of the input integer.
int _abs(int n)
This line defines the _abs function that takes an integer n as input and returns its absolute value as an integer.
if (n >= 0) 
{ 
return (n); 
} 
return (-n);
This is the main logic of the _abs function. It uses a conditional statement to check whether the input integer n is greater than or equal to zero. If n is greater than or equal to zero, the function simply returns n, as its absolute value is equal to itself. If n is negative, the function returns the negation of n, which is equal to its absolute value.
The function essentially computes the absolute value of the input integer by returning the input integer if it is non-negative and returning the negation of the input integer if it is negative.
Overall, this code is a simple implementation of a function that computes the absolute value of an integer. The function takes an integer n as input and returns its absolute value as an integer.
