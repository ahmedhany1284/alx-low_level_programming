This code defines a function named _strspn that calculates the length of the initial segment of a string that consists entirely of characters from a second string. The function takes two parameters, both pointers to the strings to analyze.
unsigned int _strspn(char *s, char *accept)
The function definition starts with a comment that explains what the function does. It says that the function calculates the length of the initial segment of a string that consists entirely of characters from a second string.
/** 
* _strspn - Entry point 
* @s: input 
* @accept: input 
* Return: Always 0 (Success) 
*/
Inside the function, a while loop is used to iterate over the characters of the first string s. For each character, a for loop is used to iterate over the characters of the second string accept. The inner loop continues until the end of the accept string is reached or until a matching character is found.
while (*s) 
{ 
for (r = 0; accept[r]; r++) 
{ 
if (*s == accept[r]) 
{ 
n++; 
break; 
} 
else if (accept[r + 1] == '\0') 
return (n); 
} 
s++; 
}
If a matching character is found, the n counter is incremented, and the inner loop is exited using the break statement. If the end of the accept string is reached without finding a match, the function immediately returns the current value of the n counter.
After the loop, the function returns the final value of the n counter, which represents the length of the initial segment of s that consists entirely of characters from accept.
return (n);
In summary, this code defines a function _strspn that calculates the length of the initial segment of a string that consists entirely of characters from a second string. It achieves this by iterating over the characters of both strings and incrementing a counter whenever a matching character is found. The function returns the final value of the counter, which represents the length of the initial segment of the first string that consists entirely of characters from the second string.
