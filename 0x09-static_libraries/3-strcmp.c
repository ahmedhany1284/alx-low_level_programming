This code defines a function named _strcmp that compares the values of two strings and returns the difference between the first two differing characters as an integer. The function takes two parameters, both pointers to the strings to compare.
int _strcmp(char *s1, char *s2)
The function definition starts with a comment that explains what the function does. It says that the function compares string values and returns the difference between the first two differing characters as an integer.
/** 
* _strcmp - compare string values 
* @s1: input value 
* @s2: input value 
* 
* Return: s1[i] - s2[i] 
*/
Inside the function, a while loop is used to compare the characters of both strings. The loop continues until either the null character ('\0') is encountered in both strings, indicating the end of the strings, or until two differing characters are found.
while (s1[i] != '\0' && s2[i] != '\0') 
{ 
if (s1[i] != s2[i]) 
{ 
return (s1[i] - s2[i]); 
} 
i++; 
}
Inside the loop, each character of both strings is compared. If two differing characters are found, the difference between the ASCII values of the characters is returned as an integer using the return statement.
After the loop, if all characters of both strings are the same, the function returns 0 to indicate that both strings are equal.
return (0);
In summary, this code defines a function _strcmp that compares the values of two strings and returns the difference between the first two differing characters as an integer. It achieves this by using a while loop to compare each character of both strings and returning the difference between the ASCII values of the first differing characters. If both strings are equal, the function returns 0.
