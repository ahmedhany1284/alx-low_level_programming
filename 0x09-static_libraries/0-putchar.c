This is a C function named _putchar that is used to write a single character to the standard output. It takes a single parameter c, which is the character to be written to the standard output.
The function is defined with the int return type, which means that it returns an integer value. In this case, it returns the value returned by the write system call.
The function is declared as extern in a header file, which means that it is defined in another source file and can be used in this program.
The function body contains a single line of code:
return (write(1, &c, 1));
This line calls the write system call to write a single character c to the standard output. The write system call takes three arguments:
An integer file descriptor representing the file to write to. In this case, 1 represents the standard output file descriptor.
A pointer to a buffer containing the data to be written. In this case, the address of the character c is passed as the buffer.
An integer representing the number of bytes to write. In this case, 1 is passed as the number of bytes to write, since we are only writing a single character.
The return value of the write system call is the number of bytes that were successfully written. The return statement in the function returns this value as the function's return value.
The function also contains a comment block immediately before its definition, which serves as documentation for the function. The comment block describes the function's purpose, parameters, and return value. It also mentions that if the function encounters an error, it returns -1 and sets the errno variable to an appropriate error code.
