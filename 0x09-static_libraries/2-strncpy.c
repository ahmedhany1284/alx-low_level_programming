This code defines a function named _strncpy that copies a given number of characters from a source string into a destination string. The function takes three parameters: a pointer to the destination string, a pointer to the source string, and an integer representing the number of characters to copy.
char *_strncpy(char *dest, char *src, int n)
The function definition starts with a comment that explains what the function does. It says that the function copies a string, which is a common operation in C programming.
/** 
* _strncpy - copy a string 
* @dest: input value 
* @src: input value 
* @n: input value 
* 
* Return: dest 
*/
Inside the function, a variable j of type int is declared and initialized to 0.
int j = 0;
Then, a while loop is used to copy n characters from the src string to the dest string. The loop continues until either n characters have been copied or the end of the src string is reached, indicated by the null character ('\0').
while (j < n && src[j] != '\0') 
{ 
dest[j] = src[j]; 
j++; 
}
Inside the loop, the dest string is populated with the corresponding characters from the src string. The j variable is incremented by 1 for each character that is copied.
If n characters have not yet been copied, a second while loop is used to fill the remaining space in the dest string with null characters ('\0').
while (j < n) 
{ 
dest[j] = '\0'; 
j++; 
}
After the loops, the function returns a pointer to the dest string.
return (dest);
In summary, this code defines a function _strncpy that copies a given number of characters from a source string into a destination string. It achieves this by using two while loops to copy the characters and then fill the remaining space with null characters. The function returns a pointer to the dest string.
